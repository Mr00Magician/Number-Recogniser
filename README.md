<h2 id ="ABOUT"> ABOUT THE APP </h2>
A web application deployed on GCP that makes use of Deep Learning to try and recognise hand-drawn (or rather, mouse-drawn) numbers comprising multiple digits. Try it here: https://number-recogniser-392811.as.r.appspot.com/
This web app is still under development and the ML model behind it can be enhanced much more to make it more accurate.

<h2 id ="HOW IT WORKS"> HOW IT WORKS </h2>
Upon opening, you will be presented with a blank white canvas on which you can draw a number using a mouse, or by touch (for mobile phones only). After drawing, click the predict button. The app will then try to predict which number has been drawn using a convolutional neural network.
